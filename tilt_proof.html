            <h3>How did it start?</h3>
            <p>I would be that guy who could not get an entire week out of a bad grade. I was sensitive, anguished and
                could be easily annoyed by life. Then I began to apply the reasoning of play on a high level League to
                my real life. I thought to myself: Why do I allow it to stress me out this way when I survived worse in
                Solo Queue? Viewing my challenges in college as a <strong>high stakes game</strong>, I came to
                understand how to be more
                patient and discover a <strong>certain discipline</strong> that I was previously unaware of. I am a
                monster that cannot
                be stressed today, and it is completely thanks to the things that I have learned on the Rift.</p>

            <h3>The Crucible: How Summoner's Rift Forged My Discipline</h3>
            <p>The lesson that I got was that League of Legends is a <strong>vicious and unhealthy environment</strong>.
                I have witnessed
                it million times: a single argument about a missed Smite or lost lane that makes one of my teammates
                choose to destroy my day. We refer to it in the community as <strong>running it down</strong>, that is
                when a teammate
                intentionally feeds the enemy, intentionally leaks team positions in all-chat, or simply goes AFK just
                to be a pain in the neck to the team.</p>

            <p>It would have tilted me at the initial stages; I would have lost my temper and focus. However, with time,
                I also discovered that since I had the ability to <strong>remain calm</strong> when a stranger was
                actively working to
                frustrate my achievements then I could manage any form of negativity that college life could give me. At
                this point, I am not losing my head when a group project partner goes missing, or I receive immediate
                feedback of a brutal kind when I am, on the one hand, given by a professor. I have learned the good
                discipline of <strong>not listening to all that noise</strong> and remain calm when faced with sabotage.
                I have not only
                learned how to play a game, I have turned into a <strong>machine without stress</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Late game</h3>
            <p>I will be frank even nowadays: I never managed to learn how to control my emotions to the latter.
                Sometimes there are days when a bad match in life pierces my armor, and I experience the old painful
                feeling of frustration. However, now the difference is that I am <strong>aware of how to deal with
                    it</strong>. I am able
                to take myself in, take a breath and rediscover my cool. A <strong>patch note is daily</strong> in my
                personal
                development; I am constantly adjusting my way of thinking and teaching myself to be more confident in
                myself.</p>

            <p>I'm still human, of course. Laziness sets in or the urge to do the easy thing is at times too strong to
                resist. But, as I did during my four year trip along the Rift, I understand that <strong>progress is not
                    a smooth path</strong>. I am still grinding, still practicing and still improving. It is my hope
                that someday I
                will stop being tilted by the distractions of life. In the meantime, I will continue to line up and be
                focused and keep in mind that <strong>as long as I do not give up, I have already won</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Tips for improvement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patience:</strong> The foundation of all growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Effort:</strong> Consistent grinding beats talent.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Adjust your build to the current meta.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Show up every day.</li>
            </ul>
